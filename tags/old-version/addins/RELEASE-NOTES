Release Notes for dacs-javalib-0.55
===================================
Updates in response to the change to syntax of DACS 
cookie names in DACS 1.4.11 and later:
   DACS:FOO:BAR:username -> DACS:FOO::BAR:username)

Added since 0.5:
o  cookie coordination of dumb-browser and DacsContext (eg,
   in middleware when a cookie is deleted its browser
   equivalent must also be deleted)
o  beginning of support for the new dacs_auth_transfer
   service for federation peering

Changes:
o  XML Beans are now built in a separate component: dacs-xmlbeans
