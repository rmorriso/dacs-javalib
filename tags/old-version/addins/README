README for the DACS Java Library Version 0.55
=============================================

The DACS Java Library (DJL) is companion software to DACS - 
the Distributed Access Control System (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dacs).

The DACS Java Library implements Java wrapper
classes for selected DACS services, and provides an HTTP client through
which DACS services may be accessed and DACS credentials obtained and managed.

The DJL is being developed to support the use of DACS in Java client
applications. Support is provided in several key areas:

  *  establishing the necessary preconditions for access

  *  hiding implementation details of DACS Web services
     (HTTP request signatures, XML reply parsing, etc)

  *  specialization of the excellent Jakarta Commons
     HttpClient library for DACS request processing 

The DJL may be used in the development of Java applications deployed in
thick-client (typically Java Swing) and middleware configurations

The DJL subproject dacs-services includes XML schema translations of the
DACS Web service DTDs.
