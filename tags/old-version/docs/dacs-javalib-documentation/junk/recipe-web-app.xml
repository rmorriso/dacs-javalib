<para>
In this recipe we bring together several components of the
&DJL; in a sample thick client application written in Swing.
The sample does nothing terribly useful in itself but serves as an example
of some basic patterns that may be used when developing a thick client application.
</para>
<para>
The top of the GUI component hierarchy is DacsClientFrame which initializes
the application, presents the results of executing canned or custom
HTTP requests and acts as a dispatcher
for DacsLoginFrame, DacsNatFrame, and DacsUsernameFrame.
