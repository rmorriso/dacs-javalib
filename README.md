DACS is a project of DSS - Distributed Systems Software.

[DACS](http://dacs.dss.ca) is a light-weight single sign-on and role-based access control system for
web servers and server-based software. 
DACS makes secure resource sharing and remote access via the 
web easier, safer, and more efficient. 
DACS is particularly well suited to providing single sign-on across organizational or departmental web servers, 
and to limiting access to their web-based resources.

The dacs-javaliub project was developed to permit Java applications (server and client) to access DACS-wrapped 
web sites and REST APIs.

*Status*

This project has withered on the vine for almost 5 years while development on the DACS project has continued apace.

Please don't don't expect anything to work.
