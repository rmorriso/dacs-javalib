TODO (this is version 0.55 - LOTS!)

The DACS Java Library is a tidy up and packaging of a collection
of Java libraries that I have used in the past to support the integration
of third-party Java applications with DACS-enabled Web servers.
Some parts are well-exercised - others not.

Here are some of the things that need more work or have yet to be started:

o  DACS configuration: CRUD for DACS entities: user, role, group, acl ...
o  middleware support: event-handling, completion of dacs-web example ...
o  integration support for DACS <-> HTTP Basic and Digest authentication
o  add authentication by mechanisms other than simple username/password,
   starting with X.509 certificate support
o  actually *design* the DacsException hierarchy
o  attention to thread safety issues - becomes important with addition of 
   support for create/update of DACS configuration
o  code cleanup:
     - remove embedded strings to properties files
     - JavaDocs - more, better
     - misc refactoring
