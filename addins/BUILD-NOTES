This is the README for the DACS Java Library (DJL).

Please see docs/dacs-javalib-documentation.html or http://dacs.fedroot.com/dacs-javalib/docs
for details on how to build and use the DACS Java Library.

The DJL distribution comprises 6 component projects:

   dacs-client,
   dacs-javalib-examples,
   dacs-services,
   dacs-xmlbeans,
   dacs-web,
   dacs_ajax and
   fedutil.

The base directory (where you found this README file) includes an ant build script
and properties file, a docs directory containing complete Java docs (including
a current version of this document) and a lib directory containing all required
third party software including two key libraries: 

     httpclient-3.0, and 
     xmlbeans-2.1.0.

Each of the subprojects was developed in the NetBeans 5.0 IDE. The NetBeans
project directory structure is included in each subproject. If NetBeans
isn't your cup of tea, you can use the provided freeform ant scripts instead.

PREREQUISISTES

The dacs-javalib requires J2SE 1.5 and ant 1.6. Ensure these are installed
and correctly configured.

BUILDING

To build all subprojects run

     ant build-all

TESTING

To test all subprojects run

     ant test-all

Note that some tests of Java Swing components will not succeed on a headless
host.

For details of failed tests, check the contents of the build/test/results
directory in the respective subproject.

RUNNING

The dacs-javalib-examples subproject includes several very simple examples
corresponding to recipes documented in docs/dacs-javalib-documentation.html
(you DID read that, right?).

Run them like so:

ant run-example-1, ant run-example-2, etc

Again, some of the examples will not run on a headless host.
